# micropython-websockets
uwebsockets without the logging errors

the same as https://github.com/danni/uwebsockets/tree/esp8266/uwebsockets but removed the logging library that doesn't seem to be included in some micropython builds.

tested on:
- Raspberry Pi Pico W
- Raspberry Pi Pico W2
- ESP32 WROVER-B (using generic ESP32 micropython firmware: https://micropython.org/download/ESP32_GENERIC/)
